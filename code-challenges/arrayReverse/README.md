# Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. 

## Challenge
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to JavaScript (eg. arr.reverse() ), return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach  
We declared an empty array and then decrementing from the end of the incoming array, pushed that value into the new array.

## Efficiency
Time: O(n) -- We have to itterate over the full array.
Space: O(n) -- We start with 1 array, and declare a second, but 2n reduces to n.
