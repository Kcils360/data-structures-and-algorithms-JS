Merge two linked lists.

Specifications
Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md.
Create a new branch in your repo called ll_merge.
Your top-level readme should contain a “Table of Contents” navigation to all of your challenges and implementations so far. (Don’t forget to update it!)
This assignment should be completed within the challenges subdirectory of the repository.
On your branch, create a folder named llMerge which contains a file called ll-merge.js

Feature Tasks
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
